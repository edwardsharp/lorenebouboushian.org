# TEACHING

I consider my class a powerful way to shift roles of student and facilitator/teacher. Using somatic visualization and exercises as a starting point, we confront our bodies and experience vocalizing as expansive resonance, movement as creature-like transformation, and performance as social disturbance. I create a space for improvisation that is both safe and dangerous: safe for the full expression and observation of the self, and an open portal to express dangerous parts of oneself–the dark, rebellious, and derelict. In this context, I make clear that there are no assumed boundaries or rules, and I instruct as I participate, breaking the barrier between student and teacher.

My interdisciplinary workshops combine voice, somatic/body based principles for performance, and work with performative objects. 
I always desire to teach people with a wide range of life practices. I have taught university students in Beirut, Lebanon (NAHNOO), Puebla, Mexico (UDLAP), and University of Kentucky-Lexington, as well as performance artists, singers, theorists, babies, poets, families. My aim is to create contact points between different kinds of people and experiences, and a temporary sense of community.

This work has spawned from three years of my performance workshops taking place in New York, Chicago, Puebla (MX), and Beirut. Recent workshops were produced through University of Kentucky-Lexington, where I was a guest artist, and The Exponential Festival. Past classes were at CLASSCLASSCLASS at the New Museum, as well as the Performancy Forum Quinquennial at Grace and GET YOUR A$$ IN CLA$$ at Abrons Art Center.

3 workshop methods I am currently practicing:
DESIRE/REVILE
As an interdisciplinary, improvisational performer and workshop facilitator, I am captivated by the underlying motives for any action. In workshops and lab-based environments, often it is assumed that we should follow our “interests” or “intentions,” when in fact our in-the-moment actions are a result not of clear-cut decisions but our relationship to the organism of bodies, room and objects around us colliding with what’s inside us. What do we want and why? What if we derailed ourselves, worked with our own insincerity, faked ourselves out, played tricks? Is it possible to create a realm where as much as possible is valid and nothing is right? Bring comfortable clothes, an object you would like to play with and can share, and writing materials. 

UNDOING
UNDOING is a workshop that synthesizes my personal research and creative practice to support investigation by a wide audience of creatives and activists. For UNDOING, I recruited the methods for creating an unstable, fertle ground for creative play that I developed with DESIRE/REVILE, and shifted into a mode that questioned the end of this kind of exploration. I began with a central question: Can a quest for liberation, and a path toward resistance, begin with our flesh and blood, and the energies and histories we contain? our acts and queries as means of working toward what justice could look like. Participants began by reading specific texts (Claudia Rankine, James Baldwin, Jamaica Kincaid), then moved into somatic and physical exercises held by the guiding question. Finally, via writing and discussion, participants reflected on the desires and motives that arose in that kind of directed somatic state, and how they could apply them to activist practices outside the room. 

A Body Is a Process
How can queer people claim space and share space shamelessly, constantly questioning and discovering, celebrating, and enacting new parts of ourselves? In this workshop, we will widen the experience of living in and as our bodies, shed layers of inhibition, and move toward transgressive freedom.
This workshop takes a playful, accessible approach to somatics and work with discussion, writing, voice, and movement. Together we'll create a space for accessing ourselves and interacting with each other in imaginative, open ways.

We will begin this journey with inquiry into how we embody queerness, what it means to us, and how we can inhabit our identities as fully as possible. Taking cues from work of queer writers and artists including Holly Hughes, bell hooks, Jamondria Harris, Juliana Huxtable, and David Wojnarowicz, we will discuss these ideas then continue our work through a writing prompt. Then, we will move through a individual and group exercises involving voice and movement, and come together to reflect on our work together in discussion. Influences in this class stem from Qi Gong, BodyTalk, Feldenkrais, and BodyMind Centering. These somatic modalities, as well as playful visualizations of the body and the room, form cohesion between moving body and sounding voice, as well as the intellectual and expressive aspects of the class.
