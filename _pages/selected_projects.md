[missdick vibrocis](https://missdickvibrocis.bandcamp.com/releases) is a noise/performance art duo featuring crypto-femme demoness Jill Flanagan of Forced Into Femininity (FIF), and garbage-mouth seabird Lorene Bouboushian, a performer specializing in dance-based social commentary.  Digesting the echo chamber of art-world desires for relevance and respectability politics into the trash compactors known as our bodies, we seek to enlighten via confusion, noise, and rubbing our theatrical makeup on you.
